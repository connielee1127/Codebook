These visits teach the parents about how to care for their disabled child.

It seeks to dissolve the barriers that rob these children of the opportunity to realize their rights.In the 1980s, the making of Mira Nair’s ‘Salaam Bombay’ (award winning film) revealed the dark underbelly of Mumbai’s streets, where several childhoods were at stake. A combination of socio-economic exigencies, political circumstances and parents’ struggle for survival created a large population of children, living and working on the streets of India. All across the country, the street children, an invisible section of the society, continued an invisible struggle on the streets of Delhi too.In the day time, children grapple with the challenges of street life. When night falls, they curl up in crevices - at the end of the platform, under a staircase, in the subway - where the possibility of security exists. Ms Praveen Nair, Chairperson and Trustee at Salaam Baalak Trust testifies: “It took us quite a while to break the ice with the boys. Sanjoy (Roy) and myself would scout the railway platforms every day, chat with the boys, however they had been cheated time and again, and we weren’t the first to propose help. So, they would laugh off our intentions but we never gave up. Finally, when we answered their urgent call for help to care for a terribly sick boy, a friend of theirs, began the never-ending bond.”Having spent quality time with these children, the founding members of the Trust realised that while most of these children were forced into these circumstances, many of them had chosen this life. What set them apart, was their chutzpah, their spirit. Ms Nair adds: “We started with the idea of donating blankets to the children in the bitter winter cold. We started at the very place where GRP centre now stands. However, we were naive about their actual needs. The children told us that sleeping under a blanket invited sexual attentions from older children. They stuffed newspapers and wore layers of clothing (all the clothes they possessed, actually) which not only kept them warm but also kept the clothes from being stolen! That’s when we realised that these children needed a roof over their heads and safe spaces.”From three staff and 25 children on a balcony of the Ground Reserve Police at the New Delhi Railway station more than 32 years ago, we have now grown to over 250 staff, providing support services for approximately 10000 children a year in Delhi and the NCR region through our 7 shelter homes and 10 contact points.Over the years, Salaam Baalak Trust has successfully worked with over 1 lakh children; out of which significant numbers have been restored to their families. Every year almost 10-11 children across SBT pursue higher education. We have children who grew up to become lawyers, fashion designers, photographers, puppeteers and engineers.

Although the attempts to place them in jobs met limited success, the engagement with children continued. After a family adopted one child, they realized that many of these children were not abandoned by their families, but had opted to ''flee'' because of certain reasons (which in most cases were not very serious) without actually thinking of the consequences.The concept of ''restoration'' or ''home-placement'' of children thus began to take shape. Ground research revealed that the parents are also distraught when the child leaves; and they often attempt to search the child without any leads. There was a zeal within the team members to work on this issue in a dedicated manner and a new organization was carved out of Prerana.

The Foundation also aims to encourage organ donation at the time of death. TANKER was started by Dr. Georgi Abraham along with a group of like-minded individuals. From providing financial assistance to needy patients and spreading awareness to providing subsidized and free dialysis, TANKER has taken every effort to live up to its vision. It currently provides services in the following areas:Dialysis: A person suffering from kidney failure can survive only when he/she undergoes dialysis or a kidney transplantation. Haemodialysis involves the use of an artificial kidney termed Dialyser, which emulates the functions of a normal kidney. It needs to be done 2-3 times a week and is an expensive process. TANKER Foundation has made dialysis affordable for economically backward sections using their Subsidised Units. Dialysis in a private hospital costs anywhere between Rs 1500 to Rs. 2500. At TANKER, dialysis is offered either free or at a subsidised rate of Rs. 375 to patients. It costs TANKER Rs.1100 for every dialysis. The shortfall of Rs.725 is covered by donations from well wishers. Presently 377 patients benefit from this every month.Fistula- An A V fistula is essential for dialysis. This is created surgically by joining a vein to an artery in the area of the wrist. Impure blood is first drawn from the fistula on the patient''s wrist, passed through the dialyser machine and clean blood is returned to the patient. A Fistula surgery costs between Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 15,000/-, which is beyond what many patients can afford. Financial Support- The Foundation helps needy patients from all over India by offering them one-time contributions ranging from Rs.1,500/- to Rs.20,000/- towards transplantation, investigation and post-transplantation medication costs. Research grants- The importance of advances in Kidney research is recognised by TANKER. Funding is provided to research projects for studies in various aspects of kidney disease. Internships and training- TANKER at its various dialysis units provides training and internship for budding nurses, lab technicians and those looking at Administrative roles. The Foundation is also a training ground for students of Social Work, Public Relations and Sociology.Organ Donation- TANKER encourages deceased-donor organ donation that can be a boon for not just kidney patients but also for others suffering from life threatening ailments. Deceased-donor organ donation is not very popular in our country and hence the recipient waiting lists are long.Deceased-donor organ donation consists of removing viable organs from brain dead donors and then transplanting them into a living patient who needs it. Soon after a patient is declared brain dead (the patient is dead but the heart maintains circulation usually with mechanical ventilation support), the organs are harvested. The harvested organs are then kept cold to delay the natural decaying process. These are then transplanted to the needy patient.TANKER under the Deceased-Donor Transplantation Programme, sponsored a meeting of surgeons and physicians in October, 2005. Their recommendation to the health Secretary resulted in the expansion of the panel of specialists who certify brain-stem death. The TANKER Trustee Doctors were part of the team that performed the first government approved multi organ deceased-donor transplant in December 1995.

The gap between education and employment was a big one to bridge - and without employment education seemed meaningless and added to the frustration of youth from these disadvantaged communities. Youth tended to drop out and meander aimlessly at the vulnerable 16 - 18 year age group. Thus was born an intervention that looked at specific career outcomes that gave purpose and direction to their lives. Antarang started with a pilot group of 20 youth from slums across Mumbai in a 6 weekend intervention. The success of that pilot and the resultant placement of >50% of youth from that group slowly led to more groups and more partnerships.Priya Agrawal has held key leadership roles in the social sector, having headed organisations like The Akanksha Foundation and SNEHA in the past.Antarang Foundation is a registered not-for-profit organisation that works with disadvantaged young adults. Through structured interventions, they motivate young people to stay in education until they are 18, after which, they train them in employability skills and place them in careers of their choice. They do this through two career focused programmes CareerAware and CareeReady.Their CareeReady programme is a career readiness and employability skills training programme for youth in the age group of 18 - 25 years. Students undergo a well-defined regiment of development and training. The program consists of 5 key aspects spread over different sessions: Career awareness, Self-awareness, Work skills, Work ethics and Business spoken English.CareeReady groups in the communities are a mix of adolescents with different educational backgrounds - some may be school dropouts, others may be pursuing their 12th or beyond. Different techniques are used to keep the batch engaged given the inconsistent educational backgrounds. Several batches of CareerReady Programme are run simultaneously across multiple locations in Mumbai. Keeping this diversity in mind, facilitators or trainers use a ''Buddy System'' which enhances learning as well as boosts confidence.Rather than a one-way dialogue, all concepts are explained with the help of role plays and various activities. Students are also encouraged to work on projects in groups. They support interactive style of learning rather than a lecture/authority style of delivery. They believe in the concept of ''Do and Learn'' and therefore, promote self-learning to develop critical thinking skills and retain knowledge that leads to self-actualisation. Trainers also use audio-visual aids as and when required to introduce an element of fun!The CareerAware programWhat do you want to be when you grow up? is at once an exciting and terrifying question for any teenager or young adult. At this stage, it is the awareness of options, the ability to make an informed choice and the process of charting out a career path that motivates adolescents and young adults to stick to education, and set career goals. In India, the Right to education ends at the age of 14, and only 1 in 2 children complete high school. The ratio of students in higher education is sadly even lower. Every school drop-out is prone to high risk behaviour, and usually end up in informal employment, characterised by low wages and no benefits.To break this cycle, Antarang introduced the CareerAware program. The program targets students who fall in the crucial 14 - 17 years age bracket. Through intensive self awareness, career awareness and career planning sessions, CareerAware encourages teenagers to stay in education until they are 18 years old. By emphasising on the number and quality of options that become available only if they stay in education, CareerAware reinforces the importance of education in young minds.', '+ 022 4005 0164', '231/C, Tawripada Compound, Dr SS Rao Road, Lalbaug, Parel, Mumbai 400012 Maharashtra', 'info@antarangfoundation.org', 'https://www.giveindia.org/nonprofit/antarang-foundation');
